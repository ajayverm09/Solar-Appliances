    title: "How does a Tankless water heater work",
    content: `Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, heat water directly without using a storage tank.
    When you open a hot water tap, cold water flows through a heat exchanger where it’s heated instantly. 
    This provides endless hot water, eliminates standby heat loss, and is more energy efficient compared to traditional tanks. 
    However, choosing the right size is important to meet household demand.`

    title: "Upgrade to a Hot Water Recirculation system",
    content: `Hot water recirculation systems provide instant hot water at every tap by continuously circulating water through the pipes. 
    This saves time, reduces water wastage, and improves overall convenience. 
    Many modern systems use timers and sensors to minimize energy use. They are especially beneficial in large homes where bathrooms are far from the heater.`
